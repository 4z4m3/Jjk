                      Yuji Itadori (虎いた杖どり悠ゆう仁じ Itadori Yūji?) is the main protagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is the son of Jin Itadori and Kaori Itadori, and the grandson of Wasuke Itadori. 
                  <br> <br>
                      Yuji was gifted with superhuman physical abilities which he masterfully combines with his cursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain Sukuna with no ill effects, which allows him to perceive the shape of souls. This enables him to harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders him immune to injury.

                    Megumi Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ恵めぐみ Fushiguro Megumi?) is the deuteragonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a grade 2 jujutsu sorcerer and first-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Yuji Itadori and Nobara Kugisaki.
                  <br> <br>
                  Overall Skill Level: Megumi is a grade 2 sorcerer and possesses one of the highest potentials of any student at Jujutsu High regardless of age. He inherited the prized Ten Shadows Technique of the Zenin clan and is favored by the strongest sorcerer himself. Satoru believes that Megumi could become as strong as he is and has stated he likely possesses even more skill and potential than Yuji.

                  Nobara Kugisaki (釘くぎ崎さき野の薔ば薇ら Kugisaki Nobara?) is the tritagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. She is a first-year student and grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer at Tokyo Jujutsu High studying under Satoru Gojo alongside Yuji and Megumi.
                <br> <br>
                Overall Skill Level: Nobara is ranked as a grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer by Jujutsu High. This is mostly due to her status as a young first-year student and inexperience working as a sorcerer. Nobara has showcased numerous times the capability to contend with jujutsu users ranked leagues above in terms of grade.

                Aoi Todo (東とう堂どう葵あおい Tōdō Aoi?) is a supporting character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a third-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High School and a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer. He was mentored by Yuki Tsukumo in his youth and considers Yuji Itadori his best friend.
              <br> <br>
              Overall Skill Level: Aoi is an exceptionally powerful sorcerer, undoubtedly one of Jujutsu High's strongest students. He obtained the rank of a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer as a student despite coming from a non-sorcerer family. Aoi single-handedly defeated five grade 1 cursed spirits and 1 special grade during the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons in Kyoto.

              Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. 
            <br> <br>
            Overall Skill Level: Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique. No one can seemingly match his skill level in the current storyline, except for the King of Curses, Sukuna.

                Ryomen Sukuna (両りょう面めん宿すく儺な Ryōmen Sukuna?), more often referred to as simply Sukuna (宿すく儺な Sukuna?), is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer from over a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses (呪のろいの王おう Noroi no Ō?), Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.
              <br> <br>
              Overall Skill Level: Back in the Golden Age of Jujutsu, the Heian Era, Ryomen Sukuna was feared and regarded by awe by all those in his time as the most powerful sorcerer of the time, defeating and killing thousands of jujutsu sorcerers even as they sharpened their skills against him.
